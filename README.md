- Star Digital, a multimedia video service provider, conducted an online controlled experiment to understand the effectiveness and return on investment of its digital advertising. The experiment had a treatment and control group, with the treatment group receiving a real promotion and the control group seeing a charity advertisement. 
- The campaign was run on six different websites, with different costs for ad serving. Star Digital aims to answer three questions:
 1) Is online advertising effective for Star Digital?
 2) Is there a frequency effect for advertising on purchases? 
 3) Which sites should Star Digital advertise on, specifically whether it should invest in Site 6 or Sites 1-5?
